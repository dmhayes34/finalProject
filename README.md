THis is the project for Code Louisville fall 2019 Front End Web Developement.

The index.html has the main code for the only page of the website.  The site is designed to click on an image to display the a new image,
hide the first image and include text about the game.  It's like opening the box of the game and getting all the contents out.  When you
click on the new image it reverts back to hiding that image, and the text and puts the box cover art back up.  

The CSS has a media query to adjust the title on larger screens.  

The about me link will unhide text just below the title. 

The home link at both the top and bottom of the page will return you to the top

The contact link should open an email with the subject line "Blind Board Gaming Question" and be sent to brewers8534@gmail.com
